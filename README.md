## Dynamic Programming



Dynamic programming solves a problem by dividing it into smaller subproblems. This is very similar to the divide-and-conquer algorithm solving technique. The major difference, however, is that dynamic programming solves a subproblem only once.

It then stores the result of this subproblem and later reuses this result to solve other related subproblems. This process is known as memoization.
